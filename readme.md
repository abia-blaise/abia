Overview
In this project, we have:
Trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify traffic signs using TensorFlow and Keras.
Saved the trained model to a file so it can be used for later predictions.
Built a Tkinter-based GUI where users can upload an image of a traffic sign, and the model will predict its class.

We break the solution into two main scripts:
traffic.py: Used for training the CNN and saving the model.
predict.py: Provides a Tkinter-based graphical interface for users to upload an image and get a prediction from the trained model.

Step 1: Training the Model (traffic.py)
This script is used to train the CNN model on a dataset of traffic signs. It expects the dataset to be organized in subdirectories, each named after a category (e.g., 0, 1, 2, etc.), and containing images of traffic signs for each category.

Step 2: Making Predictions with a GUI (predict.py)
Now that we have a trained model, we have built a Tkinter-based GUI that allows users to upload a traffic sign image and get predictions from the trained model.

Conclusion:
In this project, we have trained a CNN model to classify traffic signs and used Tkinter to build a simple GUI to make predictions on new images. The two main scripts are:
traffic.py for training and saving the model.
predict.py for making predictions with a graphical interface.
